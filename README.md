# Introduction

RiskyBits2Vec is an ongoing research project that tries to capture many important aspects of modern threat prevention at the level of static software binary analysis:
* Applying neural networks to the problem of code similarity at the binary level
* Leverage code similarity models to detect malicious code or code vulnerabilities
* Using machine learning to assign semanticly rich but compact fingerprints for code similarity search

# TODO

* Papers
* * Create a separate "papers" folder in this repo
* * Research papers that are relevant to this work and add to the folder
* * A good start is the references section to paper by Heng/Dawn Song
* Databases
* * Download relevant databases for this work
* * For example, download the databases described in the paper by Heng/Dawn Song
* * If they are too large, we need to use a Google/AWS Bucket
* Software to-Graph Tools
* * What kind of tools are available that can convert software to graphs ( ie, ACFLs ) ?
