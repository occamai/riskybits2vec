# Introduction

RiskyBits2Vec is an ongoing research project that tries to capture many important aspects of modern threat prevention at the level of software:
* Applying neural networks to the problem of code similarity at the binary level
* Leverage code similarity models to detect malicious code or code vulnerabilities
* Using machine learning to assign semanticly rich but compact fingerprints for code similarity search

# TODO

* Research all the relevant papers and create a folder in this repo
* Revisit the previous work - reproducing Heng/Song's work on code similarity via ACGS Graphs - and fix the TSNE if its possible
* Investigate other graph2vec approaches
* Investigate other contrastive loss architectures such as triplet loss
* Find and test against larger malware/vulnerability databases
